# Hairstyle
Experimental code to build a system that will show people how they would look with different hairstyles.

### Approaches:
- **FS-EncDec-Technique**: Face-Swap encoder decoder model.
- **FS-Warping-Technique**: Face-Swap using OpenCV (Image warping).
- **HS-Segment-Technique**: Pixel wise classification for hair segmentation.
